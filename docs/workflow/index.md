# Project Setup and Workflow Management

## Motivation

When working on a project, most of us spend time thinking about *what* to create (e.g., a cleaned data set, a new algorithm, an analysis, and/or a paper and corresponding slides), but not about how to *manage* its creation. This results in two major issues, as outlined next.

!!! important "Major issues in managing data-intensive projects"

    - we may lose sight of the project ("directory and file chaos")

        - Gradually, we write code and edit data sets, and put those files somewhere on our computer.
        - When we update files, we either overwrite them, or save new versions under different file names (e.g., including dates like `20191126_mycode.R` or version numbers like `mycode_v2.R`).
        - Even with *best intentions to keep everything tidy*, months or years of working on a project will very likely result in chaos.
        - For example, have a look at the intransparent [directory and file structure of a PhD project](structure_phd_2013.html) Hannes once was working on (back in 2013). Can you find the code used to estimate the final models?! (e-mail us if you do...)

    - we may find it difficult to (re)execute the project ("lack of automation")
          - The way you have set up your project may make it cumbersome to execute the project. Which code files to run, which not? How long does it take for a code file to complete running?
          - For example, you wish to re-do your analysis on a small subset of the data (either for prototyping, or as a robustness check), or you would like to try out new variables or test whether a new package provides speed gains...
          - However, re-running your project takes a lot of time - if at all you remember how to "run" the various code files you have written.

The primary mission of **managing data- and computation-intensive projects** is to build a transparent project infrastructure, that allows for easily (re)executing your code potentially many times.

## Guiding Principles

The objectives of this boot camp are:

- learn how to organize and track the evolution of your projects (e.g., by means of a proper [directory structure](directories.md), and [code versioning](versioning.md))
- learn how to automize your workflows, and make them reproducible (e.g., by using [automation](automation.md))
- learn how to [work on projects with others](collaboration.md) (e.g., by means of Git/GitHub)
- learn how to [document datasets](documenting-data.md) and [workflows](documenting-code.md)
- learn how to write clean code (e.g., see our [tips here](../tips/coding.md))

## Gradual Implementation

!!! tip "Gradually implement our tips"
    * We may sometimes sound a bit dogmatic (e.g., you must do this or that). Some of our instructions will only make sense to you after a while. So, please stick with our recommendations during the course of your first few projects. Later on, take the liberty to re-design the workflows to your needs.
    * Consider adopting our suggestions **gradually**
        1. Start with a proper [directory structure on your local computer](directories.md#data-management), which
        may already be sufficient to start collaborating. For example,
        do you need feedback from your advisor? Just zip (the relevant parts of) your pipeline
        and use [SURF's filesending service (for researchers affiliated with Dutch institutions)](https://filesender.surf.nl/) to send it!

        !!! warning "Uhh, email, really?!"
            - Indeed, email is not what we want to advocate.
            - But then again, we want you to get started with managing your workflows right away, and adhering to the directory structure outlined above already increases your efficiency.
            - So, before you proceed to the future chapters of this guide, sit back, and relax, and keep on using good old email.

        2. Start [automating](automation.md) (parts of) your pipeline
        3. Document your [project](documenting-code.md) and [raw data](documenting-data.md)
        4. Start to [track changes to your source code](versioning.md), and [clean up your source/"do your housekeeping"](checklist.md) regularly

## Configure your Computer

!!! tip "Configure your computer"
    - Note that to implement our workflow suggestions, your computer needs to be configured properly - so we [suggest you to do that first](../setup/index.md).
    - Of course, you need not to install all software tools - but pick *at least* your statistical software package (e.g., [we use R](../setup/r.md), but others prefer [Stata](../setup/stata.md)), [Python](../setup/python.md), and [`make`](../setup/make.md).
