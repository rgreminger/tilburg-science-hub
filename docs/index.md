# Tilburg Science Hub

*Tilburg Science Hub* is an open-source resource repository that supports students and researchers
in the social sciences to *efficiently manage data- and computation-intensive projects*.

To get you started, we have curated a *boot camp in scientific computing and reproducible science*.

### Boot camp in Scientific Computing and Reproducible Science

The [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/boot_camp) defines a boot camp as a "short, intensive, and rigorous course of training." In this spirit, on this website, you can

- Learn how to set up your computing environment (&rarr; [software setup](setup/)),
- Implement workflows to manage complex computational projects (&rarr; [project setup and workflow management](workflow/) ),
- Browse a library of tips & tricks (such as how to learn R &rarr; [tips and manuals](tips/learn_R.md)), and
- Get inspired by learning from various templates (&rarr; [example projects](examples/)).

Soon, we are planning on releasing resources on *creating R packages*
and on *efficiently managing web data collections using scraping/APIs and (un)structured databases*.

!!! hint "Do I really need this site?"

    - No matter how confident you are about your computer skills, the chance is that
    you *manage your projects guided by intuition*. A directory
    here, a code file there, and - oh, where to store raw data again?
    - Over the years, we have experienced that purely relying on intuition in managing
    data- and computation-intensive projects is a bad idea. After all, we spend
    a considerable amount of time studying past literature to seek an academic contribution.
    Hence, the idea to learn from others on how to manage the *process of working on a
    data- and/or computation-intensive project* shouldn't sound that far-fetched.
    - That's why we have created this site, and curated material to make sure that
    your computer skills are at par with your ambition to be a productive researcher.
    - So... what are the ways in which you can use our site?
        * Bookmark the site and check back frequently (the page is not meant to be a "one-shot" exercise).
        * Use the site to train your doctoral students or research assistants.
        * First things first: Mastering the more advanced skills advocated on this site will take you some time. But you can
        already start today with some of the easier things (e.g., by setting up [directory structures](workflow/directories.md)).
