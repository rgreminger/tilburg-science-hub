# LaTeX 
LaTeX is a great typesetting system that includes a lot of features that allow to produce scientific documents. Many researchers use LaTeX to produce their papers and presentations, and many journals require authors to hand in their articles in a LaTeX format. 

## Installing a TeX distribution
LaTeX is free to use. To use the LaTeX system, a TeX distribution needs to be installed. Detailed instructions for the different platforms are provided below.

After following the instructions, check whether everything worked by checking the output of the following command:
```
tex --version
```
This should give an output similar to this one, where version numbers and details will change depending on your platform.

!!! note "For Windows Users" 
    Download the file `install-tl-windows.exe` from [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and follow the instructions. 

!!! note "For Mac Users"
    We can install this using `homebrew`: 

    ```
    brew cask install mactex
    ```

!!! note "For Linux Users (Ubuntu-based)"
    Install it from the terminal using

    ```
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
    ```

    Note that additional packages for Tex Live should be installed through the apt package manager as well (using `tlmgr` leads to problems due to different versions)
