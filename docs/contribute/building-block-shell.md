# Goal of the Building Block

Provide a brief overview of the issue to solve, or describe why this is a best practice.

Add any special requirements or attach a dummy data set if needed.


## Code Snippet
<!-- Provide your code in all the relevant languages and/or operating systems. -->

```python
# program to check if a number is prime or not

num = 333

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number.")
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number.")

# if num is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number.")
```
