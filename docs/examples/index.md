# Example Projects

Ever wondered how a fully reproducible and automated project may look like? Get inspired here!

## The TiSEM AirBnB repository
Using publicly available data from AirBnB (available via [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)), we
illustrate how a reproducible workflow may look like in practice.

Check out our [GitHub repository for all the details on how to clone the project and run it](https://github.com/hannesdatta/tisem-airbnb).

We've crafted this project to run

- platform-independent (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- across a diverse set of software programs (Stata, Python, R)
- producing an entire (mock) paper, including modules that
    - download data from Kaggle,
    - prepare data for analysis,
    - run a simple analysis,
    - produce a paper with output tables and figures.

## Other examples (including code snippets)
- A basic example of a reproducible workflow using R and LaTeX: [example-make-workflow](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow)
- Code snippet to [download data from Dropbox](dropbox.md).
