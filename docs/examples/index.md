# Example Projects and Tutorials

Ever wondered how a fully reproducible and automated project may look like? Get inspired here by accessing one of our example projects, which you can directly use as a template to kick-start your own project!

## 1. Tutorial for a simple `Make` Pipeline

* features downloading (Twitter) JSON data from the web,
* parsing and conducting text analysis in Python, and
* running a simple analysis in R markdown

Longing to put your knowledge from our [workflow guide](../workflow) into practice? Then [follow this tutorial](../tutorial/index.md) to implement a fully automated and reproducible workflow to conduct sentiment analysis on tweets, using our [GitHub workflow template](https://github.com/hannesdatta/textmining-workflow).

## 2. A Simple `Make` Pipeline with R and Latex

[In this example](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow){target=_blank}, you
find a simple `make` pipeline, which prepares (`data-preparation`) and analyzes (`analysis`)
data using R, and creates some tables for a paper (`paper`) using Latex.

This is probably the most simplistic but still complete workflow, and
thus highly recommended as a template to kickstart your projects.

Checkout [Rafael's GitHub repository](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow){target=_blank} for all
the details! Fork it/use it as a template - contributions appreciated!

## 3. The TiSEM AirBnB repository

Using publicly available data from AirBnB (available via [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston){target=_blank}), we
illustrate how a reproducible workflow may look like in practice.

Check out our [GitHub repository for all the details on how to clone the project and run it](https://github.com/hannesdatta/tisem-airbnb){target=_blank}.

We've crafted this project to run

- platform-independent (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- across a diverse set of software programs (Stata, Python, R)
- producing an entire (mock) paper, including modules that
    - download data from Kaggle,
    - prepare data for analysis,
    - run a simple analysis,
    - produce a paper with output tables and figures.

## 4. The webscraper repository

Check out our [GitHub repository with a few web scrapers](https://github.com/hannesdatta/scraping_workshop){target=_blank} that illustrate our thinking of how to code up data collections.
